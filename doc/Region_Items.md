# Region Items

## Tips
  Use the insert region item action. It will ask for a region name and a beat division (eg 16th steps). This will create text events in the midi region item numbering the beats. This is useful for when other target region items are subregions.

  It also adds a pan envelope (going from full left to full right) to also help preview subregions
