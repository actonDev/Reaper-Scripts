![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/swu4UMv.gif)
  + `Multi double click` (for double clicking item)
  + `Region Copy & Scan Paste`
  + `Region Item Select`
  + `Escape` (multi tool to clear time sel, track sel, item sel PLUS remove temp items created for region copying
  
> More than just using region items on folder tracks, you can use them on tracks
 + whose title begin with `*` : select across all tracks (`*SONG` track in demo gif)
 + whose title begin with `^` : select the children of this tracks parent
 + whose title begin with `>` : select folling n tracks (siblings) (eg >2 will make selection on the next 2 tracks)
>
> Tracks whose title begin with `-` will be ignored from the selections (useful when making selection from `*SONG` tracks,and you want to ignore a Temporary track)

### Coloring ###

  + `Random Color`
  + `Color Swatch` (customizable, based on an image swatch.png.. Just replace it :D)

### FX Routing Matrix (MAD credits to eugen2777, also to DarkStar for his mod) ###

![FX Routing demo](http://i.imgur.com/JU5JZTe.gif)
See how all the fx are routed for the selected track/take (yeah Reaper has take FX :D)

> Uses your current theme colors only if the theme is extracted (does not work with .ReaperThemeZip files

Take FX functionality is a little limited compared to Track FX because of current API limitations (for now).
